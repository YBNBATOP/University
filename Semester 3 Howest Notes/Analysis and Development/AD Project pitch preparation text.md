# General idea and points of remark

Setup:
It is year 2084
Your task is to think of a product that will enhance Adria’s lives and serve as a way forward to  
shape a new civilisation on our blue planet.
Adria remains a perilous environment (e.g. toxic atmosphere, ...). Should the IT systems be  
corrupted, there might even be a risk of loss of life. Therefore, you should think carefully about  
this aspect of the project.

Upon arrival all Adrians are given a device which can project an interactive interface of any size  
on any surface (or even lacking surface). They can also act as a trigger to activate nearby  
sensors to interact with the environment. It comes in the shape of a wristband, with the  
projection unit on top.

# Problem
Have you ever found yourself in a situation, where you would need quick medical assistance?​

Or it might be that you would just want to have a regular check of your body for any possible disease or health issue?​

Such actions are not always possible, due to a majority of factors, that might make it impossible to access any help from within.​

Taking into consideration the perilous environment of Adria, as well as the cutting-edge technologies we are able to use in the age 2084 , we decided to put a stop to such inconvenience.​

We consider that it should be absolutely imperative for any citizen to be able to monitor his/her health issues, as it would make the life so much easier and safer on Adria.

# Solution
As a result of multiple brainstorms that we conveyed, our team conjured up a major solution that not only could save a lot of lives, but also improve the overall life quality of every single citizen of Adria, and maybe even more.​

Our team project, Lenus, brings in a very fresh and unique idea, full of highly demanded features.​
​
Our team decided to make major use of the device that every Adria citizen acquires, ones arrived to the planet, a wristband that can project interfaces of any size on any surface. ​
​
This device made it possible for us to implement a scanning application, which would check your body, allowing you to see any possible health issues or diseases that you might be experiencing, and that without taking into consideration the additional features that are present.
