Apart from a good product, it is very important to understand the market you are working with.

Also the best thing for an investor to hear - is about costs, market potentials, revenue

Investors like it when you are already ready to answer questions!

# Our project
For now (Oct - Dec) we are in bootstrap (development/experiment) moment, when we do not need money yet to actually survive.
Afterwards, we will actually have to survive, that is when the calculations and begging for money begins!

We need to actually Break-even (Costs/Revenue), and Finance Mix

## What is break-even?
#### How much "pieces" do you need to sell?
Pieces can be broad, should not be physical products: the number of hours, the number of participants, the number of downloads. the number of views, etc...
How much do I need to "sell" before I get out of mud?

#### From when?
From which moment do start to make profit?
Take a look when the profit will exceed the costs for your product!

TIPS: Use months and do the calculations over a period of 3 years;
From which moment the monthly revenues will be higher than the monthly costs?

### How do we implement it in our project?
We need to include calculation in our business case, though we should "predict" the amount of sales, and profit we can make after we actually launch our product!

## Revenue
It is very difficult to predict our future, that is why it might as well be difficult to predict how much you will make.

It is important to be realistic, and make relations to the situation nowadays.

You might need to think of different scenarios - best-case, worst-case, average-case.

You might need to think about your own company - how are you going to develop (i.e. increase costs). 

Try to explain the numbers you are predicting as good as possible by using arguments why you think it will evolve that way... you can make (or slightly fake) research that proves your predictions: comparisons with similar products, surveys you have run, tests, etc...

Of course a lot of products/services on Adria will be completely new, but you can relate to similar things on earth and use the success numbers in your advantage...

## Costs
There are multiple costs in your company.
The biggest one - is your staff members (personeel).

After the experiment/development phase not the whole group has to stay on the payroll... You have thinkg of the ideal mix in your team to prepare for the future.

Maybe in the next phase other competences are needed to grow your business?
HR consts can weigh on the budget, so be realistic if you dont want to scare the investors

Also think of the possibility of hiring freelancers: advantages? For which jobs?...

Other costs:
- Material
- Marketing
- Licenses
- Events

Investments:
- Make a depreciation table for each investment
- Monthly depreciations are costs

Make the distinction between FIXED and VARIABLE costs.


## Finance mix
You do not have to stick to one source....
It can be reassuring for the investors that oyu have other ways of financing...
But to keep the pitch relevant: the largest part of the investment should come from the investors for whom you are doing your pitch.

In return, you should think of something to give your investors as a kind of "gift" that will actually save them a bit from having issues (trust) with your project. So you get, and you give in return.
