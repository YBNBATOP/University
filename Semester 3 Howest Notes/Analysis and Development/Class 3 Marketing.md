# Definitions of Marketing
“Striving to get a certain product or service is known to your target audience  
to make sure as much revenue is created as possible”

“Marketing is the department that looks for unfullfilled needs and desires, defines them  
and measures the size and potential profits. It also discovers the target markets that the  
company can provide, designing the most fitting products and services together with the  
R&D department and also planning and executing the promotion of the offer.”

“Marketing is the art of creating value for the customer  
and getting value of the customer in return”

# BMC
On the Bussiness Model Canvas the marketing gets into the category:
Customer Relationships (how to reach the customers), Customer Segments (groups of customers we need, Channels (what do we use to reach customers)

# Marketing Mix
4 P's (Old School):
- Product
- Price
- Promotion
- Place

4 C's (Modern Way):
- Customer: Points to 'Customer Solution'.  Advantages for the customer are more important than the features of a product/service.
- Cost: It is not just the price, you also have to take into account other costs for a customer, like transportation, maintenance costs, etc..
- Communication: The ease for the client. For example accesibility, fast delivery.
- Convenience: Two way conversation != One way or 'push' marketing.

# Product/Customer
## Core product (or service)
What is the customer buying, what is the core advantage/benefit? (Ex. Software delivers efficiency gains)

## Actual product
Features of a product (Ex. Software delivers this and those modules, can make these)

## Augmented product
Non-tangible advantages (Ex. buying this software you get a training, access to the helpdesk, an uptime of 99%, ...)

## USP
USP = Unique Selling Proposition

Where do you make the difference? How do you distinguish yourself from the competition?
What makes you that unique people are choosing your product/service and are willing to pay for it?

##



# Price/Cost
## Cost-based pricing:
To calculate costs (manufacturing costs, transportation costs, overhead costs,..) and then take your profit margin above these consts.

## Competition-based pricing:
Looking at the price  of the competitors and taking a position lower or higher price.

## Value-based pricing:
"What is the customer willing to pay for it?" "What is the value for the customer?"



# Communication + Convenience
How do I get the 'right' visitors to my website/app/digital channel/event? It is all about the ways to get those visitors.

How do I get them to convert? = make sure your (potential) customer have no obstacles at all... both digital as physical.
