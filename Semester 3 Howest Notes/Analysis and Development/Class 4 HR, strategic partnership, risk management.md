# HR (Human Resources)
## Legal obligations
When starting a business there are multiple factors that can get into our way, such as: laws, security, privacy, taxes.

## Performance review
On Adria there are almost no restrictions. But we need to think of performance review (once a year, or x number of years, there is a review on how much impact there is on your work). It is mostly for people, to know whether they have advantages or disadvantages. 

## Well-being at work
It is important to make sure your employees are good and they do what they are supposed to do.

## Payroll
We need to know how much we are paying our workers. There are multiple companies that give help with HR solutions.

Such companies make sure that everything is set up.

## Organisation
We need to think about how we organise ourselves.  We need to build org charts for our companies.
Organogram/ogranigram. This is all about organising our page.

## Attracting new employees
It is important to find new employees, and keep them.
This is usually done for the recruitment via a offer. This can be either Internal (reorganisation) or External (new workers) recruitment. There are different possibilites to fill functions, by freelance, or get a straight specialist.

## Training and development
All of us are in a training. There is a difference between Training (short term), and Development (long term). It is all about knowledge management.
Ultimate goals:
- Learning organisation
- Generate and share knowledge
- Apply and adapt knowledge based on other stuff

# Strategic partnerships

Sometimes it is very important to communicate with partners
## Identification
Identification of:
- key partners
- core suppliers

Which key resources do we obtain from our key partners?
Which are our partners core activities?

## Different categories
There are multiple categories of companies that can help you.
One of such can be a **supplier** company for example.
Another option might be a transport company.
The most important it is the rivals, the competitors itself.

Strategic partnerships between competitors:
- Sharing common resources
- Small start-ups that use expensive tech together
Strategic partnerships between non-competitiors
- Joint Ventures
	- Develop new business together
- Customer-supplier relationships
	- Ensure reliable deliveries
	- Ex.: kitchen builder always needs a steady supply of materials and appliances; car manufacturers and supplier of car parts

## Why?
It is all about optimisation, lowering the costs, limiting risks and uncertainities, acquiring certain resources and activities

Optimisation/scale benefits to lower costs:
- Outsorsing, sharing infrastructure
Limiting risks and uncertainties
- Developing a standard together
- Ex.: one standard, but multiple
Acquiring certain resources and activities
- Insurance company works with independent insurance brokers instead of having a common one.

# Risk management

We do not like any risks. Those are threats.
There are multiple factors that can somehow damage your system.

Project assessment: we need to think about what can be going wrong with our project
## Risk management plan
It is created based on identification of risks
Purpose:
- Mitigate or eliminate risks
- Avoid consequences of said risks

## Risk officer
Larger organisations
Large projects
Assigns priorities to risks
Follow-up
For smaller projects, often overkill
Alternative: disscuss risks on a regular basis in your project team.

This is all about the fact that the risk office is not that important in small companies

## Risk profiles
Various methodologies to classify risks
Simple mechanism using 2 parameters:
- Impact
- Likelihood or probabilty
***Impact***: what are the consequences for the project?
***Likelihood***: how likely is it that the risk actually occurs?
Combination of both -> determines risk weight

Critical risk:
- If this risk manifests, it brings the project to a halt
- A so-called showstopper
- Must be mitigated/eliminated immediately
Major risk:
- Must be handled as soon as possible
Minor risk:
- These risks are only handled after the critical and major risks

## Handling risks (RARE)
**Research**: we need information about the risk itself, investigate more
**Accept**: what to do if the risk occurs, especially if it is unavoidable
**Reduce**: the risk can be reduced
**Eliminate**: The risk can be fully eliminated

## Inventarise risks
Determine an inventory of risks and their properties
Review and modify where applicable
Do not forget to further detail the various risks

### Examples of risks
Risk: the supplier is unabel to deliver materials in a timely fashion
- Impact: High
- Probability: High
- Risk profile: Major
- Action: Reduce
	- Fix an agreement with the supplier
	- Have a portfolio of alternative suppliers

Risk: due to short term absence of employees the planning is impacted
- Impact: Low
- Probability: Low
- Risk profile: Minor
- Action: Accept
