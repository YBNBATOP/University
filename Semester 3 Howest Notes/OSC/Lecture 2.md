# Defining OS
Hard to define
It's a manager for a lot of stuff
The link between the software we create in programming languages and the processes sharing hardware.
Something about kernelspace and userspace
"In charge of making sure the system operates **correctly** and **efficiently** in an **easy-to-use manner**."
"Layers-on-layers"

# Cloud
The first cloud provider was Amazon (AWS).
They decided to sell the CPU power that they had as idle power.
The advantage for using cloud computing is that you pay only for what you are using.
Nowadays you dont even need to install stuff yourself because it comes as a stack of software, and not just a server.
Cloud is not only about hardware sharing.

# Service separation
On-Premises - you do everyrhing yourself
Infrastructure - hardware related problem are not your problems
Platform - only data and application
Software - everything in one go

# Scaling
### Vertical Scalability
Making the thing bigger:
- Adding more memory, cpu, storage
- Has a limit
### Horizontal Scalability
Don't make 1 VM bigger - Create more VMs:
- Distribute the workload
- Load balancing







# Containerization
Docker is widely used for container creation
Used a lot now in cloud because:
- Smaller footprint
- Less resources
- Faster
- Lot of cases it doesn't matter for the user

In case of VM using, you will need to use Hypervisor, which can make creating stuff harder.


# Caveats Cloud computing

- Vendor lock-in 
Making sure it is hard for you to leave once things have been set up
- Management
Not easy to manage all groups & users who are allowed to have access
- Abstraction
One-click-solutions are easy but do you know what they do?
- Security
The easier the automation, the easier it is to forget to secure "stuff"
