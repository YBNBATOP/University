# ITIL Introduction
This are some principles that are needed for working in the IT department.
## Key concepts of service management
- we want to provide value (this is pretty much similar to the principle of Maslow piramid), we want to know what we need to bring. You want to get the first and basic needs, in order to fulfill the next needs, or higher/lower needs.
- stakeholders, organizations, understanding whoever I need to work with. Every stakeholder wants to get some kind of value. For example every service provider wants some funding from customers, hence it is a value.
- products and services - this is more of a part regarding the service itself. To get a value, you need to provide something as well. It is an exchange.
- service relationships - think about NIS2, and one of the things in there is ITIL. This is yet about the services that you use, that your services are always running and work as supposed. Like the licenses and etc.
- value: outcomes, costs, and risks - whenever you want to see what is the outcome of your investments, this is when this principle comes handy. Since you always want to have the lowest investment for bigger outcome.

## 4 dimensions of service management
In order to give the value, we need the products and services, and other people involved

- organizations and people - companies have different parts of the company, but also the company needs business. In this case, you have the different departments of the company like IT, productions, sales
- information and technology - this is the part of the company that manages the idea of what I am doing with my company, and how I position myself.
- partners and suppliers - any production need supplies, and you have customers. You have stakeholders, and everybody has its own value. Everything has an outcome and an "investment"
- value streams and processes - this is the whole way or better said stream of things that are intended for each part. Like when applying for a job - you need to get through some steps. It also refers to the organization itself, as the company wants to do the proper automation of processes. However! it is important to understand that the automation is made by the IT department, hence you are linked to your customers anyway.

# ITIL guidelines
We need this thing, hence we need the guide to achieve perfection
- Focus on value (you want to provide the maximum, however it also depends how you do it.)
- Start where you are (you start with something smaller or not really)
- Progress iteratively with feedback  (do small steps, making it easier to manage)
- Collaborate and promote visibility
- Think and work holisticaly (if you work and understand what you are supposed to do, then it will be easier for you, and sometimes you need to modify things.)
- Keep it simple and practical
- Optimize and automate

## Availability Management
Objective - ensure agreed services meet the needs of customers and users
Definition - availability which is the ability to maintain the systems up.

Availability is one of the parts that are supposed to be part of the service that you are making. You do not want failure at certain points.
## Business analysis
Objective - analysis of business, determining associated needs and recommending solutions, enable the organization to communicate its needs in a meaningful way and etc.
## Capacity and performance management
This is about the availability of a service, as you have demands for it. You want your computers/servers to behave and get enough power to support the load.
## Change control
This is about making changes to the system, like a difference of types of change and the fact it should be controlled.
## Incident management
It refers to the interruption of IT services or degradation of service performance.
## Asset management
The purpose is to monitor, plan, and manage the lifecycle of IT assets to help the organization to maximize value, control costs, managing risks and others.
## Monitoring and event management

## Problem management
## Release management
This is about doing changes to the system, and making sure that your software is tested.
## Service catalogue management
## Service configuration management
## Service continuity management
It is mandatory, as whenever you do something (like make a backup), you need to know how to make it back to work with the backup recovery.
## Service design
## Service desk
This is the thing that gets tickets and categorizes it.
## Service level management
This is service level regarding something like support and other things.
