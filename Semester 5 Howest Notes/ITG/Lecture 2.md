## Introduction to Frameworks and Policies
COBIT, TOGAF, ISO 27K, NIST CSF

### COBIT
COBIT is Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies, a framework by ISACA that helps the companies to achieve the objectives in governance and management of enterprise IT

It ensures that IT is aligned with business goals, providing value through effective risk management and resource utilization (also compliant with the laws and regulations)

It focuses on IT governance, which involves structures, processes, and mechanisms that guide and control IT resources. It also puts an emphasis on accountability, performance measurement, and strategic alignment between IT and the outer business

COBIT overall just likes to split things up a lot, even in the end it likes to split the Governance and Management layer.

Layers:
- Governance - COBIT likes structure, hence this is like the layer where they let the decision makers to take the main paths for IT resources, and use those to support the whole organization.
- Management - This layer is more upon how it provides guidance on how to build, run, monitor the IT processes. It wants to be effective.
- Performance - This layer is about monitoring performance. It is similar to GitLab milestones and other similarities (like how good we are doing)
- Compliance - This layers is about making sure that the IT operations are in rule with external regulations, standards, and internal policies. It wants to provide guides to manage risks and control processes that protect from legal, financial and reputational harm.

**You can combine COBIT with other frameworks as well.**
**By implementing the (COBIT at least) framework, it does not mean that you comply with the GDPR.**
#NOTE

### TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework)
It is more based on architecture (for enterprises of course)

ADM - Architecture Development Method, is the core of TOGAF and provides structured approach for creating, developing, and managing enterprise architecture.

The goal of TOGAF is to align organization IT infrastructure with the business objectives and strategies.

It wants to make IT integration as close as possible to business processes and goals of the organization.

It consists of multiple phases:
- understanding the architecture vision
- defining the business architecture
- developing the IT architecture (data, application, technology)
- plan + implementation of architecture

### ISO 27000
It favors Risk Management - it provides a systematic approach to identifying, assessment and solving of risks.

It is the most know framework in the series. It focuses on information security management. It wants to help organizations can manage data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.

ISO 27001 = main focus to continually improving, establishing, implementing, and maintaining a ISMS (Information Security Management System)
ISO 27002 = like an addon for 27001 as it has best practices for selecting and implementing information security controls. Controls such as access control, physical security, cryptography, and incident response.
ISO 27005 = focuses on risk management in the context of information security
ISO 27017 = provides guidelines for information security controls for cloud services
ISO 27018 = offers privacy principles to protect personally identifiable information in cloud computing environments

### NIST CSF (CyberSecurity Framework)
It is a voluntary framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to improve cybersecurity practices in the critical infrastructure

It has/bases on 5 core functions:
- Identify - help organizations understand cybersec risks, assets, data, and the threats it may face.
- Protect - focuses on implementing safeguards to ensure the delivery of critical infrastructure services.
- Detect - detect cybersecurity events in a timely manner. It covers continuous monitoring, detection processes, and anomaly detection
- Respond - implement a proper response plan to mitigate and contain the effects of the incident.
- Recover - more like RTO, as you want to get back to normal work, recovery planning, improvements, and continuous monitoring to ensure that recovery actions are effective and repeatable.

Issues are usually hard to detect, because people tend to casually resolve their issues themselves, however they only do worse things.
## Why?
This frameworks are invaluable tools for organizations of all sizes and industries.

Frameworks are complimentary and can be integrated to provide comprehensive governance, architecture, and security solutions. Organizations do need this frameworks.
## Summary
Governance - COBIT
Architecture - TOGAF
Security - ISO 27K + NIST CSF
