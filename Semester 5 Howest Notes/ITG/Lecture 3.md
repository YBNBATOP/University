# Global Governance and AI regulation
## AI governance
It is about ensuring ethical usage of AI technologies, frameworks, policies and laws.
The main objectives are to be set.
Accountability is also always the case, you want to know who is responsible.
AI governance is about creating controls over AI to protect public interests, prevent harm, and ensure accountability.

## Core principles of AI governance
### Ethics
Embedding moral principles into AI decisions
### Law
Ensuring compliance with existing laws and creating new laws tailored to AI
### Technical standards
Guidelines and protocols that dictate how AI should be designed and deployed.
## Key theoretical concepts in AI governance
- Soft Law vs Hard Law - soft is about guidelines and codes of conduct (corporate AI ethics statements). Hard is about legally binding regulations (GDPR)
- Risk-based approach - government of AI risks for society, pretty similar to EU AI Act, as you consider different risk levels.
- Precautionary Principle - governance should be more cautious when risks are not fully known.
## Core principles
- Transparency - AI system should be understandable, and decisions should be explainable.
- Accountability - mechanisms should exist for holding developers, deployers and users of AI accountable. 
- Fairness - AI must not be discriminant or unfair.
- Safety - AI must be robust, secure and resistant to manipulation or failure.
- Privacy - AI must protect user data and respect privacy rights.
## The need for AI regulation
Prevent Harm - biased decisions, discrimination, and privacy violations can be due to unregulated AI
Ensure accountability - AI should be aligned with societal values, be transparent and accountable.
Mitigate Ethical Risks - regulations help address ethical issues, that appear from autonomous systems.
## Overview of Key AI regulations
- EU AI Act - aims to regulate AI based on their risk level; targets high-risk AI areas
- GDPR - Focus on protecting personal data, enforce the principles of user consent, data minimization, transparency and accountability.

### The EU AI Act 
- Unacceptable Risk AI - threat to fundamental rights
- High-risk AI - AI used in critical sectors, with strict regulations being applied
- Limited and minimal risk AI - less obligations, but still require transparency measures
- Penalties - non-compliance with the AI Act can lead to significant fines.
### GDPR and AI
- Consent - must obtain explicit consent from user if data is being processed
- Transparency - users should know how their data is being used, processed and shared.
- Rights - AI models can be impacted, if the user decide to modify or delete data.
