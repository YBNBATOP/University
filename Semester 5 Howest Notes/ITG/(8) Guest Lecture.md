# Robotics
This guys actually remade Boston Dynamics things, but for cheaper and with work made in China and US.
It is also considered that Chinese companies are more advanced than US robots.

Robotics can also represent a shit ton of money of potential revenue
Robotics also have quite some ways they are used all around the world.

Robots (autonomous ones) have to be coded with C++ (because it needs to be blazing fast), and they have their own on-board computers, which then have functions made.

Another use case - is a blind guy dog. A real life example needs to be trained for quite some years. Hence, there is a rising popularity to get robot dogs for this people.
Sniffing dogs can also be trained, and retrained, to be very good at identifying some type of things.

They even use gaming software, and machine learning, to make the robot learn a lot of things, all at the same time.

**Waymo** is another very interesting case, because they trained a fucking car to drive around a city, and do everything just like a normal taxi driver

Not even considering that the robots WILL cause massive job loss, there will still be other jobs that are supposed to be done by people.

**Deontic** is a very interesting company because this guys are already looking to improve their robot simulations, and they also look for jobs.

One interesting thing, that there is a security mechanism, that does not allow you to get into the system, unless you make a right choice 5 times in a row, out of X amount of choices. The idea behind this is that you can not really train something to do this, this ideal 5 times in a row.
