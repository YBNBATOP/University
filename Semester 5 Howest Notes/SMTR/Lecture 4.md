# GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
## Why?
It is like a requirement linked to the risks and everything like that

Never study articles by heart (for exam)
## Introduction to data protection
GDPR is not about privacy!
Privacy:
- Private life, family life, home, communication (I want to be let alone principle)
Data protection:
- Protection of personal data, fair processing, purposes, consent (on legit base), access and rectification

It is really about data protection, and not privacy.

GDPR is not a directive, but a regulation (so like smaller advices, or how everything is supposed to be done)
## Concepts of data protection
Personal data, processing, and actors - this are key factors

Personal data - any information about an identifiable person, that can be done directly or indirectly. (Art. 4 1). It is about information that can lead to real people, and does not apply to people that are dead.
There are 2 groups of personal data:
- General - name, citizenship, phone number, languages spoken, etc.
- Organizational - business address, business phone number, etc.

Keys:
- All the information
- Regarding.
- about identified or identifiable person
- Natural person.

### Anonymous data
It is not personal data once it is truly anonymous, can not be reversed, and needed in Big Data Analytics.

It is not the same as Encryption and Pseudonymization

#### Pseudonymization
This is about detaching the data from the direct people it should connect to.

## Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
Transparency:
- The data subjects should be openly and transparently communicated about processing or personal data.

## Purpose limitation
The processing of data should be limited to a special case, and if the data is used for something else, then there should be other pivots for processing it. However further processing can be possible if only it suits the previous purpose.

## Data minimization
The data that is getting collected - it should be only relevant, necessary, and adequate.

## Accuracy
The data that is getting collected - should be updated from time to time.
Also this one is important so that you do not get access to somebody else's data.

## Storage limitation principle
It can be a legal obligation, and they want to save data for some amount of time.

## Integrity & Confidentiality
The personal data should be processed in a way that provides appropriate security.

# Lawfulness of processing
## Consent
Here you start with 0 percent lawfulness
Should be specific, clear indicate of action, freely given.
## Legitimate Interest
Here you start with 100 percent lawfulness
It is an interest of the controller or third party. Balanced against the fundamental rights of the data subject.

### Limitations
Comply with other legal obligations
Transparency
Economical interest is not enough

## Contractual agreement
Sometimes companies need your data in order to fill in the contract.

## Vital interest
That can be needed when somebody is about to die and you need its data.
## Public interest

## Legal obligation

# Rights of the data subject

# FILL IN HERE

# DPO (Data Protection Officer)
You need to inform the DPO in a couple of cases. One of such cases is when you are a public authority.
# Supervision and enforcement
First thing is that it is self regulation is the responsibility of the company.

As a civilian you also have rights and also is supposed to know that there is a data breach for example.

The companies will also have fines regarding the annual turnover depending on something wrong they do.

DPO can have multiple roles, and not necessarily a full time job.

TIP: Do not learn the things fully, try to understand what is stated. The data breach should be reported in 72 hours after noticing it. Remember rather basic things, and not too detailed (something like lawfulness and etc.)
