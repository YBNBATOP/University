# MITRE ATT&CK
This is a big ass framework that has techniques for threat intelligence, since you can also get idea about various "tactics" or things you can do.
This is the high level goals of an attacker, this tactics.

Every tactic has its "goal", as in **Execution**, or **Lateral spreading**
Then every tactic has subtactics with more specific information.

TTP - Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures - is a very important thing in threat intelligence.
Procedure is like a whole campaign, that will include the tactic and technique. 
The good part is that you can find attacks that happened, and then find mitigations.
Procedure - use of technique. Campaign - is a bunch of procedures.
Techniques can also sometimes be more interesting rather than the CVE.

Tactic - is the higher level thing. 
Technique - a smaller part from a Tactic (like command and control objective, a part of it.)
