# Case study and bullshit
This lesson is absolutely horribly structured

Controls - is the mechanism to find a solution for a threat. This can not be perfect, but those are supposed to cover some issues. It is supposed to have some effect.
At some point controls should be valued, whether they are more reliable or less expensive.

## Threats
Data protection threats - privacy threats
User threats - something that the victim does

The most important thing in the threats can be STRIDE
S - Spoofing (pretend to be someone else)
T - Tampering (GDPR also applies to integrity of the personal data)
R - Repudiation (saying that you did something but you did not) (Digital signature is A solution)
ID - Information Disclosure (also a GDPR issue)
E - Elevation of privileges

Whenever you do something with GDPR, do not forget about Article 5, the principles of processing personal data.

Purpose limitation is always a threat
