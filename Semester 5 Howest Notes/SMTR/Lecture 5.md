# Cybersecurity of organizations
For the test of certification - needs a specification of the tests that can be ran, and that can not.
#NOTE 

The whole idea of management - is to reduce the amount of threats. In Belgium for example - the amount of cybercrime does not really lowers. However, still implementing most techniques does help.
Small and medium enterprises cyber resilience decreases, unlike the bigger companies.
## Objectives for today's session
- Knowledge (awareness of EU legislation structure, basic knowledge of NIS2 directive, frameworks and schemes that enable cybersecurity protection of organization)
- Comprehension (link legal obligation to frameworks, understand the interplay between protection of organization and products, recognize and understand the elements of a framework)
- Practice cybersecurity (how to use framework and other bullshit)

## NIS2 Directive
NIS2 is literally a lot of text, legal text. However in essence it contains other parts:
- National authorities & scope
	- Competent Authority - CCB is National Cybersecurity Authority
	- National CSIRT - CCB
	- National Crisis Centre
	- Sectorial Authorities
- Identification & registration
- Risk assessment & cybersecurity risk-management measures
- Supervision model
	- Essential entities (regular audits, inspections)
	- Important entities

### NIS2 Incident Notification
24h - early warning 
72h - initial assessment of the incident 
update upon request
1month - final report

### Administrative measures and sanctions
Administrative fines are issued by CCB, but no criminal fines anymore
There are multiple regulations or factors that are represented as different fines.
It does not apply to public administration
### NIS2 Scope
There are 2 types of sectors that have high or normal criticality.
The high availability sectors can be important or essentials.
The normal criticality can be essentials max.

Annex 1 - high availability and show in which case it is important and essential
Annex 2 - same, but not high availability
# Cyber Risk Measures
## General cybersecurity requirements
## Accountability of management bodies
This is about the management being sure of what is happening and not only have legal people and other talk for the CEO for example. Since that is what brings the best company to work.
## Supply chain obligation
This is not made super important, and NIS2 puts low emphasis on it.
# Implementation timeline


When you have to choose a framework - choose wisely. If you do not have a useful one - write one (LOOOOOOL)
