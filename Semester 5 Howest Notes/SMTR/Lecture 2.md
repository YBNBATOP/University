We are going to learn about standards, legislation (like NIS2), also frameworks and more.

Objectives for today:
- Knowledge - Awareness of EU legislation and how it is structured (like to know where to look for something), Basic knowledge of CRA/CSA (what are this about?), Frameworks and schemes that enable cybersecurity of products
- Comprehension - Link legal obligation to framework, Link framework to product (make links between all of this)
- Practice - Take a look at a practical case and go through it. How to purchase cybersecure products/services, keep your products/service secure, dispose of your products/service

We will also have some homework to do, and put that in the teacher mailbox. (Before the start of December)

## Discover
I want to buy the most secure mobile device: Motorola or Samsung?

Task 1: What do you think? Motivate your answer
The reasoning should be objective.

## Basic knowledge regarding EU legislation

Regulations are directly made towards the national level
Directive is a legislation, where EU has shared goals (like NIS) - it defines goals, but to achieve them, it is necessary to translate them into National Law (which is supposed to be correspondent to the EU legislation)

## Standardisation
It is something used a lot. There are different levels of it.
Examples:
- ISO, CEN CENELEC  - Government instruments
- ETSI - Industry collaborating with government
- GSMA, SOGIS, OWASP - Private standards/schemes

The choice of standard depends on multiple factors, and usually the government standards are lacking quite some things. Industry collaborating with government are, on the other hand, easier and eager to be changed.

## Legislation and standards
Standards vs Legislation:
- Voluntary - Mandatory
- Consensual - Imposed by Law
- Developed by independent organisations - Established by public authorities
- Revised every 5 years - Revised when legislators decide (usually know shit about technology)
- Provide specifications and test methods - Sets requirements to protect public interests

Between Regulator and Enterprise, we usually see combination modes of regulation
## Reading standards
Requirements: Shall/Shall not
Recommendation: Should/Should not
Permission: may
Possibilities and capabilities: can/can not

## EU CyberSecurity Act
It is a voluntary certification framework.
There are no tools to say what device (or anything) is more secure to take,  than the other
CSA = CyberSecurity Act

### CSA Assurance levels
Assurance level indicate risks associated with intended use

Basic - minimize the known basic risks of incidents and cyber attacks
Substantial - minimize known cyber security risks, and the risk of incidents and cyber attacks from actors with limited skills and resources
High - minimize the risk of advanced cyberattacks

## EU Cyber Resilience Act
CRA = Cyber Resilience Act

The problem: Too many connected products (IoT) are put on the market with low cybersecurity standards & **known vulnerabilities**
- Many attacks could have been avoided by sinple patches
- Users are not aware, and manufacturers are supposed to make the smallest things to make it real

The CRA imposes new minimum cybersecurity requirements for all "products with digital elements" for the EU market, and the products are supposed to be appliance to some small things.

Before an item can be sold in EU, manufacturer should:
- Submit a Cybersecurity Risk Assessment
- Comply with the CRA "essential security requirements"
- draft User instructions
- draft technical documentation
- issue a Declaration of conformity - CE marking

During the whole product lifetime (at least 5 years, or less) manufacturer must do other things

CRA cybersecurity requirements = same for all products, but ...
different levels of control depending on the criticality

# HOMEWORK
Get an IoT device from my environment, and in the course material find the ETSI 303 645 standard on cybersecurity for consumer IoT devices. Can I check based on this standard if this IoT device complies to this "basic" standard?

To be sent to the teacher Johan Klykens
**Deadline 10th of December**
