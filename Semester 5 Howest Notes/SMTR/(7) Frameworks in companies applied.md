## Determining the scope of ISMS
This thing is regarding the internal scopes of the company. The idea is to have a scope definition/description.

The pitfall is that the product or process is certified with ISO27001. It is the ISMS that gets the certification, as you specify that the whole thing is certified and not only the specific part.

The outsourced things should be also mentioned in the ISMS.
Scope is very important, as it describes what I am doing in my ISMS.
## Information security management system (ISMS)
The ISMS is a theoretical concepts, but it looks more like an internal wiki, and a monitoring platform. This is more like management (that can provide information about your systems and other things)

## Leadership and commitment
Top management must demonstrate leadership and commitment, as the mission is to check and accept some things like:
- Set objectives and strategy for the ISMS
- Validate the roles and responsibilities of key interested parties in the project
- Validate the security policies of the ISMS
- others, related to ISMS management.

## Information security policy
There are various levels for policies, starting from high-level general policies, and ending with topic-specific policies. ISO27001 does not require you to have super much documentation. It requires only a couple of things, that can be put into one document.

ISO27001 also provides examples of the roles that should be present in the company.

## Classification of security controls by function
There are different types of controls. They are different by the function they have, but still can have various levels of being a control.

There are 2 types (most) of controls, like a technological, and person control
