# Module 1

## Module 1.1
- Another term for rogue wireless hotspots is “evil twin” hotspots. - This is when a user connects to a fake free network and then the sessions get hijacked.
- When the PDF opens, ransomware is installed on the employees’ computers and begins the process of gathering and encrypting corporate data. - Phishing is the most profitable thing
- Stuxnet was designed to infiltrate Windows operating systems and then target Step 7 software. Step 7 was developed by Siemens for their programmable logic controllers (PLCs). - USB Drives are evil, and the things on them are evil as well
## Module 1.2
Threat actors:
- Amateurs/Script kiddies - barely understand what they are doing
- Hacktivists - Hacktivists are hackers who protest against a variety of political and social ideas.
- Financial gain - scammers, getting access to bank accounts, ransomware and etc.
- Governments

IoT devices:
- “Dyn Analysis Summary of Friday October 21 Attack” - get a lot of IoT devices being compromised by malware, form a botnet, and fuck everyone up
- Avi Rubin’s TED talk, “All Your Devices can be Hacked.” Dr. Rubin is a Professor of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University.
## Module 1.3
"One of the more lucrative goals of cybercriminals is obtaining lists of PII that can then be sold on the dark web.". PII - **Personally Identifiable Information**. This relates to card numbers, social security numbers and etc. This information can be used to do other things like take short term loans.

A subset is PHI - **Personal Health Information** - protection of this information is regulated by HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is US, and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in EU.

Another subset is PSI - **Personal Security Information** - this is about cyber world things like websites or networks.

Companies are also scared of the competition and the fact that their clients can not be protected.

Governments should also be aware, as politically motivated hacktivists exist.
# Module 2
## Module 2.1
Main parts of SOC (**Security Operations Center**) are People, Processes, and Technologies.
Clients usually ask for cybersecurity professionals help, which then build an SOC on site for the clients, or contract some equipment for them.

SOC jobs:
- (Tier 1) Alert Analyst - checks incoming alerts and verifies incidents
- (Tier 2) Incident Responder - checks the tier 1 things that have been found + says actions to be done
- (Tier 3) Threat Hunter - super humans with a lot of knowledge especially in malware analysis, doing research on new threat detection systems
- SOC Manager - this guy talks to the customer and manages all the resources of SOC

Day of an analyst starts with a queue of added alerts, to be investigated.
Once an alert is confirmed, then it is being forwarded to investigators or other security personnel.
If the ticket cannot be resolved it is getting sent to the upper tiers.

SOC needs a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management System). SIEM has to make sense of all the data, network, IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems) and other devices.
Overall SIEM is meant to include:
- Event collection
- Security monitoring
- Security control
- Log management
- Vulnerability assessment
- Vulnerability tracking
- Threat intelligence

SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) is paired with SIEM. SOARs are pretty much the same thing as investigating alerts, however it also adds some threat intelligence and automating investigation of incidents and have automated responses.
Such automations allow personnel to do more important things.

SOC Metrics:
- Dwell Time - time that the threats have access to the system, and before they are eliminated
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) - average time to identify that something really happened
- Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) - average time that takes to respond and recover an incident
- Mean Time to Contain (MTTC) - the time required that takes to stop the incident from spreading and causing more damage
- Time to Control - the time to stop the spread over the network of a malware

Each business has a certain tolerance of downtime. Preferred downtime is usually measured in the number of downtime minutes in a year
