Encrypting the data in Windows can be really useful at some point.
EFS = Encrypted File System
EFS allows to encrypt specific files/folders.

Each volume has its own key. It also has a general master key.
You can also have bitlocker on removable devices.

BitLocker keys can also be stored somewhere on the AD. That is an option.
Home versions of windows have Device Encryption (a bit less handy) than the Pro (BitLocker)
