# Getting started

## Linux Server Security
Prior knowledge of linux is a must, with packages and etc.
Debians are getting their codenames from the Toy Story
We are going to use a couple of RHEL and Debian machines.
We are going to create the own VMnet (without DHCP server)
And then we will create the pfsense machine to play the role of router and etc.

## Linux network configuration
We have to set up everything manually.
Whenever you make a change - you need to reload the process that is going to check the config file.
