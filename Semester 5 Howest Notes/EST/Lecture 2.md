# ICS Part 2: PLC Programming
It is needed to learn the language of PLC

PLC = Programmable Logic Controller - the product in the factory, that knows the whole production process. It knows the whole factory and need to be intact.

## Birth of PLC
Initially there were electrical relays, and wires that were controlling everything.
Now we use electrical schemas.
PLC were designed to get rid of the wires, and work with only one device.

## Blocks of PLC
PLCs can be compatible of various blocks. They are immune, noise wise. Modular, standard I/O connections and signal levels.

Apart from Signal Board (SB), you can also add a CM (Communication Module), SM (Signal Module)

**NOTE**: For the exam need to know the main variables for PLC Programming Languages; how to address something in memory.

## Programming
Structured Programming  (ST) - Looks like Pascal
Functional Block Programming (FBP) - literally build blocks all around
Ladder Logic Programming (LD) - it is mostly relays, and simulates gates being open or not
Sequential Function Charts (SFC)
