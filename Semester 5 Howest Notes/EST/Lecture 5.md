# SDR 2: Digital Signals
We already learnt about analog radio, and the sounds that are mostly audio.

In order to send a signal, we need **Baseband**, with **RF Oscilator** and a **Modulator** in order to send it via the **RF Power Amplifier**.
## Modulation of digital data
There is:
- AM Modulation (Amplitude Modulation) - this one is rather simple, it is susceptible to noise, and might be less effective
- FM (Frequency Modulation) - modulation and demodulation does not catch any noise
- PM (Phase Modulation) - de/modulation is more complicated than the AM and FM, does not catch any channel noise, used in satellites 

## Digital encoding
Analog signals can be demodulated into digital signals, and then decoded into data.

There are various types of decoding
## ADS-B
This is a signal that every plane actually sends to the ground.
