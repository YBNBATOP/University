In datacenter we already studied how we can deploy our own things. Virtualization, building and managing our own cloud, and knowing our infrastructure inside out
Then we can get a provider for our cloud. Which is then linked to a provider, and we get a layer of abstraction

Public cloud also exists (where you manage your things, but the hardware is not yours)

For certain reasons, we can get to work with **Terraform**.
It is kind of similar (by the idea) to **Kubernetes**

## Kubernetes
It is an orchestration for containers. It can do a bunch of things like getting things up and automating a bunch.
The learning curve is steep, but it can be very interesting afterwards.
It is so smart, that you just specify your workload, and then the software decides everything for you
### 101
You create a cluster and deploy it, to automate application deployment and scaling by providing an ecosystem of tools to fit your needs
Nowadays we also go from Monolith to Microservices. We want to deploy (and impact) separate services.
You do health checks to then have load balancing.
As we also want scalability, here comes Borg, because Google had a lot of users and it costed them a lot of money.
